# Spotiview
Ever wondered what my Spotify looks like and don't but don't want to visit my account? Now on [Spotiview](https://rjjanse.shinyapps.io/spotiview/) you can find out! Thanks to [Howard Wilson](https://github.com/watsonbox)'s [Exportify](https://watsonbox.github.io/exportify/) I was able to derive basic information from my playlists. These culminated in an overview of some basic descriptive statistics of each playlist.
